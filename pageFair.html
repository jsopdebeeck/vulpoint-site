<p>Being sure that we have basic agreement on some facts is important. I hope this is also your values. For me it is common sense:<p>

<h1>Client respect, references</h1>
In a business relation respecting the client (safety ethic, privacy, transparency, contract ... ) is my n°1 focus, but respecting people including ourself should be our top priority.<br>
Using my references / CV requires my approval for each customer or new submission,<br>
Ensure my references are not already communicated to the customer via another company,<br>
I'm working with delivery in mind. Scrum and Agile when possible.<br>
<h1>Ethic</h1>
I try to avoid Military sector (even if I was 11 years in the French Army), Pharma and Drugs companies for ethical reasons; idem with Financial sector,<br>
I want to avoid competition between people I'm working for and I will respect my engagement of Non-competition, secrecy / confidentiality. So, don't ask for slides, content and possible products from competitors. I segregate.<br>
<h1>Rate, Transparency and subcontracting</h1>
The rate must be transparent between the final customer, you and myself, and<br>
I will not accept more than one intermediate between me and the client,<br>
<h1>Mobility</h1>
I will not drive 6 hours for a job if I can have the same locally.<br>
In case of a major Incident or a Crisis, you can count on me 24/7 (hackers don't sleep).<br>
<h1>Skills</h1>
I don't speak Dutch (so be sure you don't suggest me missions with that requirement),<br>
I'm not a developer and no more a system or network admin (unless you accept my rate),<br>
I'm an Infosec guy (CISO/Security Manager) specialised in:
<ul>
<li>Information and Cyber Security, including cloud technologies</li>
<li>ICT Risk Management and Governance</li>
<li>Incident and Crisis management</li>
<li>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</li>
<li>NIS regulation</li>
<li>Data Privacy / GDPR</li>
</ul>
I'm not a Lawyer in GDPR
<h1>Availability and contact</h1>
I usually don't reply to UK, France, Germany phone calls because I will need an assistant if I respond to all 'body-shoppers' and 'head-hunters' requests. Belgian and Luxembourg market is already well represented locally, so my priority is local economy.
Yes, I'm really busy because I focus my time on my customers or I'm with my family (including possible holidays).<br>
Contact me by email, with transparency, humanity and I will reply as soon as possible.

Kinds regards<br>

Jean-sébastien<br>
