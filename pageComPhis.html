<h1 id="Subject">Message, following a phishing attack</h1>


<h2>As a reminder:</h2> 
<p>Hackers are very active these days, especially during phishing campaigns, but also during data leaks by breaking into web applications to retrieve user data, including the login, which is often an email address, and the password. To prevent all of your accounts from being compromised as a result of data theft, there are a few simple rules to follow that can save you a lot of trouble.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do not use your business address (xxx@company.com) privately. This is not allowed by the way (see User Acceptable Policy)</li>
	<li>Do not use the same password as the one set to access your mailbox. This little trick will prevent, if your password is stolen from any site, that the hacker takes control of your mailbox with all the consequences that this can entail (sending spam, recovery of personal data,...)</li>
	<li>Use a random password generation software, such as Keeper Security, or set a strong password (at least 12 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special character) and not containing personal information</li>
</ul>
<p>If unfortunately your data has been stolen, it is important that:
<p>Notify the CISO (ciso@company.com)</p>
<p>You change your password immediately</p>
